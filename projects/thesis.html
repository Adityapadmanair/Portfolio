    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      A thesis project focusing on interactive visualization of large-scale 2D datamaps directly in a web browser. 
      Designed for researchers and engineers handling scientific data. Project was later bought and published as a software by IMTEK Freiburg for NETCDF data handling in contact mechanics. 
    </p>

    <h2>How it Works</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Data collected from NetCDF files using Node.js and Axios.</li>
      <li>Visualization rendered as color maps on HTML5 canvas with WebGL.</li>
      <li>As we zoom further in more and more data gets called and loads.</li>
      <li>It works on the principle that we don't really need the entire data when the user is completely zoomed out.</li>
      <li>This makes reduce the loading time and makes the transition smoother. </li>
      <li>Supports seamless zooming, panning, and interaction even for images up to 10GB.</li>
      <li>Elegant UI built with Tailwind CSS and vanilla JavaScript.</li>
    </ul>
