    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>What began as a fun little solo project is now a fully fledged app. I’ve been a big fan of football and  coding and I thought why not mash it up together? 
Presenting to you the Football Betting Simulator. Play the betting game without real money and have fun. The odds are all made by a particular algorithm that I have curated. I have more exciting plans for the app, like adding more leagues, scoreboards, battling other users and more. This is just a beginning. Stay tuned for more.</p>

    <h2>How it Works</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Users start with in-game currency.</li>
      <li>Place bets on fixtures with odds-based rewards.</li>
      <li>Integrated league tables help in predictions.</li>
      <li>The bets open when it is 3 days before the matchday. </li>
      <li>If the user predicts correctly, the user will get the amount of in game currency times the odds.</li>
      <li>The results are updated once all the games for the matchweek are done. </li>
    </ul>
